string is a collection of characters
string is a predefined java class 
string also behave like data type
it is a final class of java,if class is final it means class cnanot be inherit
string objects are immutable
$ Premitive = value type.
premitive = behave in immutable way.
What is premitive datatype/ simple type.
intern()is a method in a string this method is used to check the string exist in pool or not.

premitive= primary type.
premitive = inspired with c, c++
it is also called value type 
because it store value only
int float double etc small case (internally they are key words )
keywords are reserved words, and compiler knows these.
so it know how much memory is going to allocate for premitive,so this is get decide oon compiler.
*Immutable means change as per the need to make the copy *.   
$ Nonpremitive = reference type/complex type.
it store the reference(Address)
Variable is capable to store some small byte of data(4,8 byte)
~ String is a collection of characters.
java makes a memory at the backa=end calledd heap called object in this a sapce called string
there are two ways to make object 
1~ is literal inside the pool(1 or 0 object) 
2~ is new = is makes object ourside the pool(2 or 1 object)
Q.How stringbuilder is muthable ?
Q.how string buffer works internally
Q.diff bw string buffer and string builder 
input:aMit sRIVAStaVA
Output:Amit Srivastava
using string method  
StringBuffer is synchronized i.e. thread safe. It means two threads can't call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously.	1.StringBuilder is non-synchronized i.e. not thread safe. It means two threads can call the methods of StringBuilder simultaneously.
2)	StringBuffer is less efficient than StringBuilder.|	StringBuilder is more efficient than StringBuffer.
3)	StringBuffer was introduced in Java               | StringBuilder was introduced in Java 1.5

string buffer is used to increase the capacity of string length when new modification is needed then in the string then string buffer is needed.

new capacity = 2*old capacity+2
if length is greater than old them the new formula is =
string buffer is used where synchronizatoion is used
string builder is used when synchronizatoion and not synchronizatoion is used here is a keyword

work of input stream
taking input from three wways
1 keyboard
2 network
3 file
when keyboard giving input then system.in is used.
streaming = flow of data Ex-pipe fill the coller;
buffering = video comes from database, chunk of data which predefined the size by sender,
piece of data Ex-bucket fill the coller;
scanner is a buffer, 
but system.in.read()takes the input from user not scanner.

Recursion = 
-Call stack
-local variables memory initialization
-return statement working
Call Stack(lifo)=call the function one by one call stack maintain the function call
-recursion id=s definded as process calling itself.
-breaking of large problem into small  instances
